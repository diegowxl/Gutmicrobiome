# Tree of Life, a project of building the largest gut microbiome data set on earth.

Hi, I am Xiaolin (Diego) Wang, Northwestern undergraduate class of 2025, majoring in statistics, economics and religious studies. 

This project is conducted under Dr. Degregori with the Amato Lab at Northwestern and the Knight Lab at UCSD.

It should be filled with a large amount of 16s rRNA gut microbiome sequencing data amplifying the V4 region of various animals, with some shotgun sequencing/metagenomic data on the side.

My personal goal of this project are:
1. Conduct a whole dataset analysis of the 16s rRNA data with Dr. Degregori with all the data available using R
2. Conduct a comparison analysis of the shotgun sequencing/metagenomic data
3. Analysis and try to discover core gut microbiomes in the Animal kingdom
4. Predict potential pathogens

I (Diego) am lazy and I am not a CS/DS major (Also my first time using github), so this project is not very organized on my side.

Thanks for reading this README.md
